# note-taker

##USER STORY 

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

##DESCRIPTION

This is a note taking app, that will store your notes over time, so they do not delete themselves upon leaving the page.
All you have to do is enter your text into the the note fields that take up the majority of the screen, and click the save
button when you have finished writing your note.  Your notes will be stored to the side of the screen, and when you click them,
your note's text will reappear in the large part of the screen.
